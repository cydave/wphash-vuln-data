    "details": "The Restaurant Menu \u2013 Food Ordering System \u2013 Table Reservation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.3.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions called via AJAX actions such as forms_action, set_option, & chosen_options to name a few . This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform a variety of administrative actions like modifying forms, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
