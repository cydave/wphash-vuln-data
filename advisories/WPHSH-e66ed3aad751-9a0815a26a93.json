    "summary": "FIXME",
    "details": "The Ultimate SMS Notifications for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.4.1 via the 'Export Utility' functionality. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, such as a subscriber, to add untrusted input into billing information like their First Name that will embed into the exported CSV file triggered by an administrator and can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.",
