# wpha.sh - Vulnerability Data

This repo contains WordPress and eco-system related vulnerability data.

All advisories are stored as individual files in this repository. They are
formatted in the [Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) format](https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/).

The database is free and open source and is a tool for and by the community.
Submit pull requests to help improve our database of vulnerability information
for all.


## Quality / State of the data

This repo includes both user contributed and publicly available vulnerability data and as such varies in both accuracy and quality.
The affected version numbers are unfortunately quite a pain to get right, if you stumble upon invalid data feel free to contribute!


## Contributing
